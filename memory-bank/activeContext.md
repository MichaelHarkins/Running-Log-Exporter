# RunningLog Exporter CLI â€“ Technical Context

## Overview

The RunningLog Exporter CLI is a Typer-based command-line toolkit for exporting, organizing, and journaling workout data from running-log.com. It is designed to be robust, flexible, and to keep all athlete-specific data organized in dedicated subdirectories. The CLI supports custom output directories, granular refresh/reset logic, and detailed metadata tagging for downstream processing.

## Key Features

- **Athlete-centric directory structure:** All state, debug, and journal files are stored under a subdirectory named after the athlete.
- **Custom output directory:** The `--output-dir` option allows TCX files to be exported to a user-specified directory, keeping the workspace clean.
- **Granular refresh logic:** Use `--refresh-all` to reset all processed WIDs, or `--refresh-wids` with a comma-separated list to reset only specific WIDs.
- **Robust metadata tagging:** All exported TCX files include a `META:` block in the `<Notes>` field, with an `exported_from=running-log` tag for downstream detection.
- **Journal generation:** The `create_journal` command generates a Markdown journal from TCX files, ignoring technical meta tags and handling multi-line comments.
- **No test_workout command:** The CLI has removed the test_workout command for clarity and simplicity.

## Directory Structure

```
/<workspace-root>/
  <athlete_name>/
    output/         # Default output directory for TCX files (can be overridden with --output-dir)
    debug/          # Debug files
    state/          # State files (e.g., runninglog_state.json)
    journal/        # Markdown journals
```

## CLI Commands

### export

Exports all workouts for an athlete.

**Options:**
- `--athlete-id` (required): Athlete ID to export.
- `--output-dir`: Custom output directory for TCX files (default: athlete-specific output/).
- `--force`: Clear athlete-specific export directory and reset state before export.
- `--refresh-all`: Reset all processed WIDs before export.
- `--refresh-wids`: Reset only the specified WIDs (comma-separated, e.g. `--refresh-wids 12345,67890`).
- `--concurrency`: Number of concurrent workout exports (default: 5).

**Behavior:**
- If `--output-dir` is specified, TCX files are written there; otherwise, they go to `<athlete_name>/output/`.
- State, debug, and journal files always remain under the athlete-specific directory.
- `--refresh-all` clears all processed WIDs; `--refresh-wids` removes only the specified WIDs from state and deletes their TCX files.
- The `META:` block in each TCX `<Notes>` includes `exported_from=running-log`.

### create_journal

Generates a Markdown journal from TCX files.

**Options:**
- `--athlete-id` (required): Athlete ID to create journal for.
- `--output-dir`: Directory to read TCX files from (default: athlete-specific output/).
- `--out-file`: Output Markdown file (default: `<athlete_name>/journal/journal.md`).
- `--timezone`: Timezone for parsing TCX files.

**Behavior:**
- Reads TCX files from the specified output directory.
- Ignores technical meta tags (e.g., `exported_from=running-log`) when generating the journal.
- Handles multi-line comments and notes, rendering them as multiple lines in Markdown.

## Metadata and Journal Handling

- The `<Notes>` field in each TCX file contains a `META:` block with key-value pairs (e.g., `META:comments=...;title=...;exported_from=running-log`).
- The `exported_from=running-log` tag is always present for downstream detection.
- When generating the journal, the logic strips out technical meta tags and converts literal `\n` to real newlines for proper Markdown rendering.

## Removal of test_workout

- The `test_workout` command has been removed as it was redundant and not useful in the current workflow.

## Example Usage

```sh
# Export all workouts for an athlete, using a custom output directory
runninglog export --athlete-id 44524 --output-dir /tmp/my_exports

# Refresh all processed WIDs before export
runninglog export --athlete-id 44524 --refresh-all

# Refresh only specific WIDs
runninglog export --athlete-id 44524 --refresh-wids 12345,67890

# Create a journal from a custom output directory
runninglog create-journal --athlete-id 44524 --output-dir /tmp/my_exports --out-file my_journal.md
```

## Notes

- All state and debug files remain under the athlete-specific directory, regardless of the output directory for TCX files.
- The CLI is robust to multi-line comments and technical meta tags, ensuring clean journal output and reliable downstream processing.
