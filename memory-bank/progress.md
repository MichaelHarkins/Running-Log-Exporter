# Progress

## What Works
- All code has been migrated to a modern src/runninglog/ package with a clean core/cli split.
- CLI commands (export, test-workout, sanitize-tcx-dir, create-journal, audit) are fully functional and mapped to modular core logic.
- Project uses a src layout and explicit package discovery for robust pip installation.
- Global runninglog CLI command is available via [project.scripts] and pip install -e .
- All import, packaging, and entry point issues have been resolved.

## What's Left to Build
- Remove the old RunningLogExport/ directory to prevent confusion and import conflicts.
- Add developer documentation and usage instructions (README).
- Optionally, add unit tests and CI for further robustness.
- Continue feature development in src/runninglog/.

## Current Status
- Migration to modular, testable, and installable Python project is complete.
- CLI and core logic are cleanly separated and ready for further development.
- Project is ready for onboarding, extension, and distribution.

## Known Issues
- None with the new src/runninglog/ structure.
- Old RunningLogExport/ directory may still exist and should be removed.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Adopted src layout and explicit package discovery for modern Python packaging.
- Separated all user interaction (CLI) from pure logic (core).
- Resolved all legacy import and packaging issues.
- Established a robust, maintainable foundation for future work.
