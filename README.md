## Garmin Uploader Environment Variables

Before using the Garmin uploader CLI, you must set the following environment variables in your shell:

```sh
export GARMIN_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
export GARMIN_PASSWORD="your-garmin-password"
export GARMINTOKENS=/Users/youruser/.garminconnect
```

Replace the values with your actual Garmin Connect credentials and token directory. These variables are required for authentication and token management.
